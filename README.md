This repository is an example of a responsive webpage made with trhe aid of Bootstrap. it consists of three pages; About, Portfolio and Contact.

For the About page I used Bootstrap to create the navbar and footer. I manually added the rest of the content, edited the colour scheme and altered some of the design elements. The most of the elements on the page were already responsive, as Bottstrap does a lot of that by default, so all i had to do was float the image and the text wrapped around it appropriately.

The Contact page was almost all bootstrap, except for the basic style/layout design elements that are the same across all three pages. As the main elements were all bootstrap, it was already responsive, so I didn't have to touch it.

The Portfolio page require more fiddling and googling, but I made it so they depending on the width of the window, the number of colums will change from three, to two, then finally to one.
